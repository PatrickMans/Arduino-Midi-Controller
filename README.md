# Arduino-Midi-Controller

The first steps on building an FBV floorboard using an Arduino and a 2-line LCD display. 
This is used to drive the various Line 6 POD devices.

The communication between the FBV and the POD is based on the MIDI protocol, however with different codes. The only (diy) hardware will be a midi interface for reading from the POD and sending to it. 

In a later phase, a (de)mux is added to read the (foot)switches and drive the LEDs.
